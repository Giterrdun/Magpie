How does it respond to

My mother and I talked last night.
-Tell me more about your family.

I said no
-Why so negative?
The weather is nice.
-Interesting, tell me more.
Do you know my brother?
-Why so negative?

To prioritize the response check which keyword comes first that will be the subject.

Question
1. It responds for that keyword. the chatbox will respond to mother with tell me about your family while the sentence has nothing to do with your mother.
